    "Background": {
      "text": "First colonized by the Spanish, the islands came under British control in the early 19th century. The emancipation of enslaved people in 1834 disrupted the twin islands' sugar industry. &nbsp;Contract workers arriving from India between 1845 and 1917 augmented the labor force, which boosted sugar production as well as the cocoa industry. The discovery of oil on Trinidad in 1910 added another important export that remains the dominant economic industry. Trinidad and Tobago attained independence in 1962. The country is one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean thanks largely to petroleum and natural gas production and processing. Tobago has greater tourism potential but continues to recover from an 18-month travel ban imposed in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. The government is struggling to reverse a surge in violent crime."
