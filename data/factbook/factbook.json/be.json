    "Background": {
      "text": "<p>Belgium became independent from the Netherlands in 1830; it was occupied by Germany during World Wars I and II. The country has since prospered as a modern, technologically advanced European state and member of NATO and the EU. In recent years, longstanding tensions between the Dutch-speaking Flemish of the north and the French-speaking Walloons of the south have led to constitutional amendments granting these regions formal recognition and autonomy. The capital city of Brussels is home to numerous international organizations, including the EU and NATO.</p>"
