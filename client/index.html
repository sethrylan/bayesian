                        <p>
                        'Guessing' here refers to a properly calibrated probability estimate. If one were to guess the gross domestic earnings of <em>The Goonies</em>, the answer would probably be wrong, not because of profound personal faults, but because this tests specific domain knowledge. Rephrasing the question as:
                        <blockquote>
                        &ldquo;What are your high and low estimates for the gross domestic earnings of the <em>The Goonies</em>? What interval estimate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval">confidence</a> would give this range?&rdquo;
                        </blockquote>

                        The answer might be:
                        <blockquote>
                            &ldquo;Between $100,000 to $100,000,000, inclusive, with 90% confidence.&rdquo;<sup class="note" title="The exact <a href='http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=goonies.htm'>answer</a> is $61,389,680.">[note]</sup>
                        </blockquote>

                        Given enough data points in a sufficiently ideal world, the estimated confidence interval would match the observed accuracy. In other words, the range estimates given with 90% confidence should &ndash; on average and with minimal variance &ndash; be correct 90% of the time<sup class="cite" title="AlpertRaffia1982"></sup>. This changes the exercise from a measurement of trivia knowledge to a measurement of ability to gauge uncertainty.  However, much fewer than 90% of answers with 90% confidence will contain the actual value, not because of a lack of public knowledge in 20th century film economics, but because humans habitually display overconfident estimates. What we know is about 10-35 percentage points less than what we think we know in this example<sup class="note" title="A plot of these effects look like <a href='http://goodmorningeconomics.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/intro-calibration-chart.jpg'>this</a>.">[note]</sup><sup class="cite" title="LichtensteinEtAl1982"></sup>.

                        <blockquote><p>
&ldquo;The narrative fallacy addresses our limited ability to look at sequences of facts without weaving an explanation into them, or, equivalently, forcing a logical link, <i>an arrow of relationship</i> upon them.

                        Remember that weekend project, sitting unfinished months later?

                        Even if you don't live in a region with legalized gambling or work in a forecasting profession, everyday failures of estimation hurt your job and quality of life. You make decisions based on uncertainty and imperfect knowledge, knowing much less than you think you know. As far as ubiquitious problems of human existence, it's right up there with communicable disease<sup class="note" title="<blockquote>&ldquo;No problem in judgement in decision making is more prevalent and more potentially catastrophic than overconfidence. As loving Janis (1982) documented in his work on groupthink, American overconfidence enabled the Japanese to destroy Pearl Harbor in World War II. Overconfidence also played a role in the disastrous decision to launch the U.S. space shuttle Challenger. Before the shuttle exploded on its twenty-fifth mission, NASA's official launch risk estimate was 1 catastrophic failure in 100,000 launches (Feynman, 1988, February). This risk estimate is roughly equivalent to launching the shuttle once per day and expecting to see only one accident in three centuries.&rdquo;</blockquote> <p> &mdash;Scott Plous, <i>The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making</i> (p217)</p>">[note]</sup>.

                        Overconfidence follows a predictable pattern. Overconfidence is usual for difficult assessments (although slightly less for true/false tests<sup class="cite" title="Hubbard2010"> p64.</sup>). In some cases, very easy questions inspire underconfidence<sup class="cite" title="LichtensteinEtAl1982"></sup>. Calibration can help to correct this. A few recommend techniques are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Consider the reasons why your judgment might be wrong<sup class="cite" title="Plous1993"> p228.</sup>.</li>
                            <li>Range estimates to reduce the anchoring effect of a point estimate. Particularly, working towards a narrow range for an absurdly large range<sup class="cite" title="Hubbard2010"> p64-5.</sup>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Things that don't fix overconfidence:
                        <ul>
                            <li>More information. Paradoxically, providing more information to the problem increases one's confidence in the answer, but not accuracy<sup class="cite" title="Oskamp1965"></sup><sup class="cite" title="KassinFong1999"></sup>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                        Most importantly, feedback and iterative practice allow us to improve our estimation techniques<sup class="cite" title="LichtensteinEtAl1982"></sup>, hence the purpose of this project.
